# Network-Intrusion-Detection
This project implements a hybrid Intrusion Detection System using LSTM and CNN to capture temporal patterns and spatial features from network traffic data. With proper preprocessing (label encoding, normalization, and correlation-based feature selection), the model achieves an impressive 99% accuracy in detecting intrusions.

🔐 Intrusion Detection Using LSTM-CNN Hybrid Model
This project presents a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using a hybrid deep learning architecture combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to accurately detect and classify malicious network activities by learning both temporal and spatial features from traffic data.

🚀 Key Highlights
✅ LSTM Layer: Captures sequential dependencies and temporal patterns in network traffic.

✅ CNN Layer: Extracts local features and patterns for enhanced representation.

✅ Hybrid Architecture: Combines the strengths of LSTM (memory) and CNN (pattern detection) to boost performance.

✅ Achieved Accuracy: 99%, outperforming traditional machine learning models.

✅ Preprocessing Steps:

Null value removal

Label encoding

Standardization

Feature selection using correlation

✅ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

🧠 Why LSTM + CNN?
LSTM handles time-based dependencies in sequences (like packet flow patterns).

CNN extracts meaningful local features (e.g., port anomalies, byte patterns).

Their combination enables deep feature extraction and sequence learning simultaneously.
